## Setup

### Environment
We manage our environments with `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.
Install `uv` [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended), or run `pip install uv`/`brew install uv`.
We recommend reading a bit about managing projects in `uv` [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) (you will not regret it!).

You can now run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary.

### Jupyter Notebook

We've included a `playground.ipynb` notebook in the root directory for experimenting with the CS336 basics implementation.

To run the notebook:
```sh
# Option 1: Use the provided script
./run_notebook.sh

# Option 2: Run directly with uv
uv run jupyter lab playground.ipynb

# Option 3: Open Jupyter Lab without specifying a file
uv run jupyter lab
```

The notebook will automatically use the uv-managed environment with all project dependencies.

### Run unit tests


```sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
